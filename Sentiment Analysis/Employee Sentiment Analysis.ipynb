       "9  More Dallas ASE Information The start time for Tuesday morning has been changed from 9am to 8am.  \\nBreakfast will be served at 7:30.  Therefore, shuttle pick up times at the \\nhotel for Tuesday morning have been changed to 7:10, 7:25, and 7:40 am.  \\nAgain, the last shuttle is not recommended if you intend to have breakfast at \\nthe ASE.\\n\\nSome of you had asked about a coordinated dinner for Sunday night.  Since \\narrival times into Dallas vary greatly, we are leaving you to your own \\ndevices for Sunday night.  We are however, planning a group dinner for Monday \\nnight after we wrap up for the day.  We will arrange transportation from the \\nASE to the restaurant and from the restaurant back to the hotel.  Currently, \\nMonday's agenda shows a completion time of 6:30pm.  Therefore, we are \\nplanning to head to dinner directly from the ASE without a break or trip back \\nto the hotel. \\n   \n",

       "9  The start time for Tuesday morning has been changed from 9am to 8am. Breakfast will be served at 7:30. Therefore, shuttle pick up times at the hotel for Tuesday morning have been changed to 7:10, 7:25, and 7:40 am. Again, the last shuttle is not recommended if you intend to have breakfast at the ASE. Some of you had asked about a coordinated dinner for Sunday night. Since arrival times into Dallas vary greatly, we are leaving you to your own devices for Sunday night. We are however, planning a group dinner for Monday night after we wrap up for the day. We will arrange transportation from the ASE to the restaurant and from the restaurant back to the hotel. Currently, Monday's agenda shows a completion time of 6:30pm. Therefore, we are planning to head to dinner directly from the ASE without a break or trip back to the hotel.   \n",

       "9  More Dallas ASE Information The start time for Tuesday morning has been changed from 9am to 8am. Breakfast will be served at 7:30. Therefore, shuttle pick up times at the hotel for Tuesday morning have been changed to 7:10, 7:25, and 7:40 am. Again, the last shuttle is not recommended if you intend to have breakfast at the ASE. Some of you had asked about a coordinated dinner for Sunday night. Since arrival times into Dallas vary greatly, we are leaving you to your own devices for Sunday night. We are however, planning a group dinner for Monday night after we wrap up for the day. We will arrange transportation from the ASE to the restaurant and from the restaurant back to the hotel. Currently, Monday's agenda shows a completion time of 6:30pm. Therefore, we are planning to head to dinner directly from the ASE without a break or trip back to the hotel.   \n",

    "- Sentiment Distribution: Only Positive and Negative sentiments found. No Neutral labels detected — a point for future correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trends Over Time: Email volumes and sentiment patterns show clear peaks, likely related to major company events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Common Words Analysis:\n",
    "  Positive emails often contain words like \"com\", \"enron\", \"know\", \"thanks\".\n",
    "  Negative emails show \"com\", \"enron\", \"know\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualizations: Created bar charts for sentiment counts, time trends, and most frequent sentiment words.\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "  The EDA highlights data quality, sentiment imbalance, and important word patterns. These insights will support better sentiment modeling and deeper     employee engagement analysis moving forward."

       "1002  I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned. I am sure that both ot you know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources for ERMS support. Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy. And with the assumption that Sitara will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned as one of our key, strategic systems. There is much to do to \"catch up\", if you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several years during the Sitara development stage. And our business continues to grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going basis. I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS as soon as possible. We need to understand how day-to-day production support will be managed and how development work will be effectively handled. I will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible.   \n",

Whatever the risk was prior should not matter. Since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset. If the VAR calculation does not match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted. Phillip   \n",

    "- Utilized natural language processing (NLP) to extract sentiment polarity scores using TextBlob.\n",
    "- Created a feature from the body text of emails rather than the full concatenated text to reduce noise and focus on the core message.\n",

    "# Effectiveness & Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using body text as the input significantly outperformed the full_text approach, achieving a lower MSE (0.86 vs 7.46) and a positive R² score (0.08).\n",
    "This suggests that focusing on core message content improves predictive power.\n",
    "However, the R² score remains low, indicating that linear regression only captures a small portion of sentiment variance. It validates that while linear regression provides a basic baseline, more advanced models (e.g., decision trees or transformers) may be required for higher accuracy."
